# Olympic Medal Prediction Analysis

I've been personally wondering if thereâ€™s more to Olympic success than just the medals? My project has an end goal of looking deep into the numbers behind the podiums, examining not just the total count of medals but how factors like GDP, population, and population density play a role.

Not stopping at surface-level stats. The end goal of my analysis aims to:

- **Dig into the Data**: Gathering and scrutinizing historical medal counts, GDP figures, population statistics, and more.
- **Uncover Patterns**: Through detailed exploratory analysis try to reveal trends and correlations that may not be immediately obvious.
- **Build Predictive Models**: As a personal learning excercise try to replicate with any level of accuracy a model which could predict / replicate any medal count from any olympics.
